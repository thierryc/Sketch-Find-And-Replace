# Find and replace for Sketch 3

Finds text in selected layer(s) and all layers contained within - and replaces it with different text.  Now updated to do partial, case sensitive and full-document matching.

## Installation
Download and unzip, then double-click on the .sketchplugin file to copy it to the plugins folder and install automatically into Sketch 3. 

## Usage
**Menu** - You can access it from the menu **Plugins -> Find And Replace -> Find and Replace**  
**Keyboard** - Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut **cmd + shift + f**

**Complex documents** - If you have an extremely complex document, and set the scope to the entire document, it might take a few seconds longer to process it all.  Don't panic if you get a beach ball, it hasn't crashed Sketch, it just has to go through every layer in every artboard in every page and do a comparison.

## Options
#### Search scope
How much of your document it will actually search  
* If you have selected layers to search in, then **Selected layers** will be chosen automatically.
* You can also choose to search all layers in the **Current page** 
* Or you can search the **Whole document** and it will search every layer in every artboard in every page of your document.

#### Case matching
Whether it matches exactly as you typed or not
* **Case insensitive** by default ("john" will match "John") 
* **Case sensitive** it will match exactly as you typed it ("john" won't match "John").

#### Case replacement
How it deals with capitalisation when replacing
* **Intelligent** by default - In intelligent mode and, in conjunction with other search options, it will analyse the current capitalisation and try to match your replacement if possible.  
  * For example, if you find "smith" and replace with "Street" it will match the "Smith" in "John Smith" and change it to "John Street", preserving the capitalisation.  
  * It might also match "Blacksmith", but rather than change it to "BlackStreet" it would recognise that it wasn't capitalised to begin with and change it to "Blackstreet".  
  * If it was "John SMITH", it would recognise the all-capitals presentation of "SMITH" and change it to "John STREET" to preserve the capitalisation.
* **Standard** - Replaces exactly what you typed, so could change "John Smith" to "John Street", "Blacksmith" to "BlackStreet" and "John SMITH" to "John Street" 

#### Where to match
Where in your text layer it should match the search term
* **Exact match only** will match your Find text against a text layer if it is *exactly* the same (example "John Smith" will match text layers that read "John Smith").  If you have whitespace (or line breaks) at the start or end, this will *not* match and you should use "Anywhere in layer" as your option (or remove the whitespace - what's the point?!)
* **Anywhere in layer** will do a partial match (example "Smith" will match against "John Smith" and replace the word "Smith" only).
* **At start of layer** will only match at the start of the text layer ("John" will match against "John Smith", but "Smith" won't).  If you have whitespace at the start, this will *not* match.
* **At end of layer** will only match at the end of the text layer ("Smith" will match against "John Smith", but "John" won't). If you have whitespace at the end, this will *not* match.

#### Match whole words or phrases only
Whether it matches whole or partial words
* **Yes** (default) will match whole words ("oh" will not match "John")
* **No** will match partial words ("oh" will match "John", if you wanted to change him to "Joan" for example)

## Other features
* **Default find text** - If you have a text field selected, it will use that text as the default find text
* **Remembers your settings** - Remembers your settings for next time you do a find/replace (doesn't remember find/replace/scope as these will change each time)

## Future development
* **Regex search** - Maybe implement a full regex-based search for power users

I take no responsibility for what you find and replace, or for any changes made unintentionally due to this software erroring.  I do test it before I release it so the chances of bugs are minimised, but still, use wisely and completely at your own risk. Remember, cmd-z is your saviour.*
